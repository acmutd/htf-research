    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### PEG Ratios\n",
    "The **PEG ratio**, which is short for Price over Earnings-to-Growth ratio, is a ratio of how much a stock is priced compared how much a company makes (adjusted for growth). A low PEG ratio will tell you that the stock is trading lower than how much the company makes, and a really high PEG ratio tells you that the stock is trading much higher than what the company makes.\n",
